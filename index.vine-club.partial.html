                    package for a Luxury Club member.
                    We ship our products via the Fed Ex, GSO, and UPS ground network. The client must be a person of
                    over 21 years of age. If you want to pick up your order, you will not incur this fee. If the order
                    comes back to us, you will pay $8 for reshipping. </span>
                <span class="how-works__body__block-text">We will charge $10 for shipping if we send a club order that
                    is flagged for a receipt. We require
                    a written correction of all addresses, cancellation of membership, and credit card 30 days before
                    the next dispatch.</span>
